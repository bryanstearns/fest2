      <li>Got a question that we missed? Ask us using the 
          <%= link_to "Feedback Page", feedback_url %>, and we'll 
          get you an answer; maybe we'll add it here!</li>

  <h4>What's this all about?</h4>
  <p><%= link_to "Festival Fanatic", "http://festivalfanatic.com" %> and 
  <%= link_to "Conference Fanatic", "http://conferencefanatic.com" %> 
  (we're two sides of the same coin) seek
  to improve the experience of attending these events.</p>
  
  <p>Film festival attendees usually have just a few screening opportunities
  to see each film, so our automatic scheduling mechanism can help you see 
  more of the films you really want to see. Conference attendees don't have
  this problem, but it's still handy to have a tool to help you plan your
  sessions.</p>
  
  <p>As time goes on, we'll add features for
  coordinating your schedule with your friends', and for discussing
  the films you've seen (or presentations you've attended) with others. We'd 
  also like to work more closely with event organizers to promote community
  among attendees.</p>
</li>

<% unless conference_mode %>
<li>
  <h4>How do I use automatic scheduling?</h4>
  <p>Click on a festival in the list on the home page; this will take you
  to the list of films for that festival.</p>
  <p>(This next part is easier if you've got the paper schedule for 
  the festival; alternatively, you can open the festival's own 
  site in another browser window.) For each of the films in the festival,
  decide how interested you are in seeing that film. Enter your choice by
  clicking on the Films page.</p>
  <p>When you're done prioritizing the films, click the "Schedule 
  Automatically" button. Your priorities will be used to select screenings of
  as many of the films you picked as possible.</p>
  <p>Switch to the Schedule page for the festival: you'll see the 
  schedule arranged on grids, one per day, with the selected screenings
  color-coded.</p>
  <p>You can make manual changes to the screening selections by clicking
  on the grid.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <h4>How does the automatic scheduling really work?</h4>
  <p>In computer science, there's this thing called the "traveling salesman 
  problem": given a salesman who wants to visit a bunch of cities, how can you
  determine an optimal route?</p>
  <p>It turns out that this problem is really hard, and the problem of finding
  an optimal schedule for seeing preferred movies at a film festival is just 
  as hard.</p>
  <p>So, this site takes the easy way out, and doesn't try to solve the 
  problem perfectly; it just tries to do a pretty good job: the site makes a list of
  the films you've ranked, but haven't picked screenings for; it sorts this list
  by a combination of your ranking and the number of remaining screenings
  (the fewer remaining, the higher in the list the film goes), then tries to
  assign screenings in that order, without ever letting two assigned screenings
  conflict.</p>
  <p>There are probably better strategies, but this one seems to work pretty
  well.</p>
</li>

  <h4>Can I add my own favorite <%= _[:festival] %>?</h4>
  <p>Not by yourself, just yet, but we're working on it. In the meantime, drop
  us a line on the <%= link_to "Feedback Page", feedback_url %> and we'll set something up.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <h4>What other features are you working on?</h4>
  <p>The short list includes (in no particular order) <% unless conference_mode %>letting you sort 
  the films in different ways on the films page (by how you've ranked them, for instance), <% end %>
  better printed formatting, <% unless conference_mode %>letting you say what days or times you can 
  attend a festival (to restrict the automatic screening process),<% end %> and formatting a tiny 
  schedule page for your iPhone or Treo. Again, if you can think of something to add to the list, 
  <%= link_to "we'd love to hear about it", feedback_url %>.
  </p>
  <p>Down the line, we want to make good on the promises in the banner on the front page, adding 
  discussions<%= ", ratings for films," unless conference_mode %> and other community features. 
  We'd also like to work more directly with <%= _[:festival] %> organizers, too, helping
  to improve the social experience around <%= _[:festivals] %> (so if you're running a 
  <%= _[:festival] %>, <%= link_to "please contact us!", feedback_url %>).</p>
<li>
  <h4>Where'd you get the nifty icons?</h4>
  <p>The <% unless conference_mode %>flags (<%= %w{us br dk np ke au}.map {|co| flag_icon_tag co }.join(" ") %>)
  and many of the other <% end %>icons we use (like <%= image_tag "fam3silk/film_go.png" %> 
  and <%= image_tag "fam3silk/date.png" %>) come from web developer Mark James, who asks only that we 
  <%= link_to "link to his site", "http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/" %> to use them - done, and thanks, Mark!

  <h4>Who created this, and why?</h4>
  <%= image_tag "bryanstearns.png", :width => 100, :height => 100, :style => "float: left; padding-right: 10px;" %>
  <p>"We" is really just me: I'm Bryan Stearns, a software developer based in Portland, Oregon.
  I created this site because I want to get more out of the events that I attend, and to help my friends as well.</p>
  
  <p>I also wanted to develop and show off my expertise at web 
  application development using the Ruby programming language and the Rails framework. 
  I'm hoping that my next job will use these skills. (For more 
  information, see my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanstearns" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>
  profile; you can contact me through the <%= link_to "Feedback Page", feedback_url %>.)</p>
