  <h4>What's this all about?</h4>
  <p><%= link_to "Festival Fanatic", "http://festivalfanatic.com" %> 
  seeks to improve the film festival experience for serious film fans.</p>
  
  <p>Film festival attendees usually have just a few screening opportunities
  to see each film, so our Scheduling Assistant can help you see 
  more of the films you really want to see.</p>
  
  <p>As time goes on, we'll add features for
  coordinating your schedule with your friends', and for discussing
  the films you've seen (or presentations you've attended) with others. We'd 
  also like to work more closely with event organizers to promote community
  among attendees.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <h4>How do I use this thing?</h4>
  <p>First, sign up, so we'll know who you are when you come back to the site.</p>
  <p>Then, click on a festival in the list on the home page; this will take you
  to the "Your Film Priorities" page for that festival.</p>
  <p>(This next part is easier if you've got the paper schedule for 
  the festival; alternatively, you can open the festival's own 
  site in another browser window.) For each of the films in the festival,
  decide how interested you are in seeing that film: you've got five choices, from "I don't want to see this" to "I *really* want to see this". Enter each choice on that Film Priorities page.</p>
  <p>When you're done prioritizing the films, click the "Scheduling 
  Assistant" tab; if there are times where you can't attend the festival, enter them. Then, click "Schedule Films" - your priorities will be used to select screenings of as many of the films you prioritized as possible.</p>
  <p>After your schedule's been generated (it takes a moment), you'll see "Your Festival Schedule": your schedule for each day, with the selected screenings
  color-coded.
  <p>You can make manual changes to the screening selections by clicking
  on the grid. If you click on a screening for a film you're scheduled to see at some other time, the other screening will be unselected for you (because why see it twice?); likewise, if you're scheduled for any screenings at the same time as the one you clicked on, they'll be unselected too (because you can't be in two places at once).</p>
  <p>As the festival proceeds, as you hear good or bad things from your friends,you can revise your priorities, then ask the Scheduling Assistant to rebuild the rest of your schedule.</p>

  <h4>How does the automatic scheduling really work?</h4>
  <p>In computer science, there's this thing called the "traveling salesman 
  problem": given a salesman who wants to visit a bunch of cities, how can you
  determine an optimal route?</p>
  <p>It turns out that this problem is really hard, and the problem of finding
  an optimal schedule for seeing preferred movies at a film festival is just 
  as hard.</p>
  <p>So, this site takes the easy way out, and doesn't try to solve the 
  problem perfectly; it just tries to do a pretty good job: the site makes a list of
  the films you've ranked, but haven't picked screenings for; it sorts this list
  by a combination of your ranking and the number of remaining screenings
  (the fewer remaining, the higher in the list the film goes), then tries to
  assign screenings in that order, without ever letting two assigned screenings
  conflict.</p>
  <p>There are probably better strategies, but this one seems to work pretty
  well.</p>

  <h4>Can I add my own favorite festival?</h4>
  <p>Not by yourself, just yet, but we're working on it. In the meantime, drop
  us a line on the <%= link_to "Feedback Page", feedback_url %> and we'll set something up.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <h4>What other features are you working on?</h4>
  <p>The short list includes (in no particular order) letting you sort 
  the films in different ways on the films page (by how you've ranked them, 
  for instance), better printed formatting, and formatting a tiny schedule 
  page for your smartphone. Again, if you can think of something to add to the list, 
  <%= link_to "we'd love to hear about it", feedback_url %>.
  </p>
  <p>Down the line, we want to do more to build community around festivals, 
  adding discussions, ratings for films, and other social features. 
  We'd also like to work more directly with festival organizers, too, helping
  to improve the social experience around festivals (so if you're running a 
  festival, <%= link_to "please contact us!", feedback_url %>).</p>
<li>
  <h4>Where'd you get the nifty icons?</h4>
  <p>The flags (<%= %w{us br dk np ke au}.map {|co| flag_icon_tag co }.join(" ") %>)
  and many of the other icons we use (like <%= image_tag "fam3silk/film_go.png" %> 
  and <%= image_tag "fam3silk/date.png" %>) come from web developer Mark James, who asks only that we 
  <%= link_to "link to his site", "http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/" %> to use them - done, and thanks, Mark!

  <p>"We" is really just me: I'm Bryan Stearns, a software developer based in Portland, Oregon.
  I created this site because I want to get more out of the events that I attend, and to help my friends as well.</p>
