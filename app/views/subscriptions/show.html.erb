<p>We'll try to build you a schedule that includes as many of your higher-priority screenings as possible. Before we do, we need to know about your availability:</p>

<% form_for @subscription, :url => poly_festival_settings_path(@festival) do |f| %>
  <%= f.error_messages :header_message => "Oops, something went wrong..." %>

  <% if @festival.has_press_screenings? %>
  <p>
    <%= f.check_box :show_press %> Should we include the press screenings? (If this box isn't checked, we won't show them on your schedule.)
  </p>
  <% end %>

  <p>
  Are there are times you can't attend this festival? Enter them here
  and we won't schedule any screenings for these times (though we'll still
  show them on the schedule, and you can still pick them manually).
  </p>
  <p>
  This feature is brand new and kind of finicky: you should enter things like
  <i>2/5, 2/6 -10am, 2/8 11:30am-2pm & 8pm-10pm</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.text_field :restriction_text, :size => 80 %>
  </p>

  <% if @ask_about_unselection %>
  <p>
  You've got existing screenings selected... what should we do about them?
  <%= select("subscription", "unselect", [
    ["Unselect all the future ones", "future"], 
    ["Unselect all of them", "all"],
    ["Leave them selected; just fill in around them", "none"]]) %>
  </p>
  <% end %>

  <p>
    <%= f.submit "Schedule Films" %>
  </p>
<% end %>
