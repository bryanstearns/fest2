Hi festival fanatic!

Sorry, but one of your selected screenings has been <%= @change_type == :cancellation ? 'cancelled' : 'changed' %>:

  <%= @screening.film.name %>
    <%= @screening.times %>, in <%= @screening.venue.name %>

<% if @festival.updates_url.present? -%>
Visit the festival's schedule-updates page to see added screenings and other
changes:
  <%= @festival.updates_url %>

<% end -%>
The schedule at Festival Fanatic has been updated; you can visit
  <%= festival_url(@festival) %>
to view and edit your schedule.

Don't forget: you can always return to the Schedule Assistant page and
regenerate your schedule from this point forward -- we'll keep the films
you've already seen.

...Bryan

(P.S. Don't want these notifications about your schedule? Just reply to
