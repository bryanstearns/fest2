Hi festival fanatic!

Sorry, but one of your selected screenings has been <%= change_type %>:

  <%= @screening.film.name %>
    <%= @screening.times %>, in <%= @screening.venue.name %>

<% if @festival.updates_url.present? %>
Visit the festival's schedule-updates page to see added screenings and other
changes:
  <%= link_to @festival.updates_url, @festival.updates_url %>
<% end %>

The schedule at Festival Fanatic has been updated; you can visit
<%= link_to festival_path(@festival), festival_path(@festival) %> to view and
edit your schedule.

Don't forget: you can always return to the Schedule Assistant page and
regenerate your schedule from this point forward -- we'll keep the films
you've already seen.
